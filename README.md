Hello! I'm Ethan Holdahl, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Williams College where I teach Intermediate Microeconomics and Game Theory. My research is primarily in experimental economics and game theory when I look at how different designs affect the evolution of behavior in populations. I completed my PhD at the University of Oregon in 2023 and am on the job market for the 2024-2025 cycle.
