Hello! I'm Ethan Holdahl, a PhD student at the University of Oregon. 

I do research in game theory and environmental economics and I have a passion for creating and using interative software.

Consequently, I try to use Shiny (R) and oTree (Python) as much as I can. One goal for my career is to create a wide array of interactive content displaying my research as well as interactive educational content that is as accessible as possible.

Please visit my website at [EthanHoldahl.com](https://ethanholdahl.com/) to learn more about me and to check out some of my shiny apps!
