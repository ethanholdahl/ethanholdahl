Hello! I'm Ethan Holdahl, a PhD student at the University of Oregon. 

I do research in game theory and environmental economics and I have a passion for creating interactive software for my projects. This is beacuse I believe a primary barrier to learning is how <i>boringly</i> the material is presented. Of course, creating interactive software takes time and there is a tradeoff between how accessible material is and how precicely the information is conveyed. However, my belief is that by using visual and interactive software I can convey information more quickly in an engaging way that will make consuming my research less arduous, and perhaps make economics more approachable and accessible to the general population.

Consequently, I try to use Shiny (R) and oTree (Python) as much as I can in accompanying my work and as a resource in my teaching. I am inspired by [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimerLearning) and [bill wurtz](https://www.youtube.com/user/billwurtz) on Youtube and am working to develop my programing skills to expand my toolset to create even more accessible and entertaining content. 

Please visit my website at [EthanHoldahl.com](https://ethanholdahl.com/) to learn more about me and to check out some of my research and educational content! All of which, of course, is stored here on Github.
